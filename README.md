# Connect-Four
Connect Four Game Against an AI

This program is a connect four game based on a player deciding to go first or letting the AI go first. Code such as loops, structs, pointers, functions, integers, 
characters, and linked lists got implemented to create this connect four-game and make it work similar to how it does in real life. Pointers got used to construct the board
by also using structs provided in the course file, linked lists with their nodes, and the print function after connections were made in rows to print them and handle
the linked list of the grid in a more feasible way. The AI got create by using rand and srand so it can take in random moves, and it also took in the same way of winning the 
game as the actual player has it made. No arrays or global variables got used in this program, only linked lists. Comments got added to the parts that were not too repetitive. 
Most of the game code went to the main; however, there were functions created to automate repetitive code to make the code shorter. The game consists of you playing until you 
connect four either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, and the same goees to the AI. At the end of the game, the game record moves from both the player and the AI 
shall get printed.
